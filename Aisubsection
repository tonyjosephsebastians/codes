SUBSECTION CREATION RULES (MANDATORY):

• A new subsection may ONLY be created if the text EXPLICITLY begins with a subsection identifier 
  such as "(1)", "(2)", "(a)", "(b)", "(i)", etc., as visibly written in the document.

• DO NOT create a new subsection based on:
  - Square brackets [ ]
  - Drafting notes
  - Optional language
  - Paragraph breaks
  - Introductory phrases (e.g., "For all legal proceedings...")
  - Capitalization or formatting changes

• Any paragraph, sentence, or block of text that does NOT begin with an explicit subsection marker 
  MUST be treated as a CONTINUATION of the immediately preceding subsection.

• Bracketed or optional paragraphs (e.g., text starting with "[" and ending with "]") 
  MUST remain within the SAME subsection they appear under and MUST NOT be promoted 
  to a new subsection or section number.

• The subsection identifier sequence must match the document exactly.
  DO NOT infer, renumber, normalize, or auto-increment subsection numbers.
