NESTED SUBSECTION SPLITTING (KEEP SAME JSON STRUCTURE):
- If a subsection contains nested labels like "(a)", "(b)", "(c)" inside it, you MUST split them into separate items inside "subsections".
- Keep the SAME keys for each item:
  { "subsection_id": "...", "parent_clause_number": "...", "subsection_text": "..." }

HOW TO FORM subsection_id FOR NESTED ITEMS:
- Parent subsection "(5)" with nested "(a)" becomes subsection_id "(5)a"
- Parent subsection "(5)" with nested "(b)" becomes subsection_id "(5)b"
- Parent subsection "(5)" with nested "(c)" becomes subsection_id "(5)c"

CHECKBOX ITEMS:
- If you see checkbox markers like "[x]" or "[ ]", treat EACH checkbox line/item as a separate nested subsection.
- subsection_id must include the checkbox marker plus a running index in appearance order:
  Examples under parent "(5)":
  - "(5)[x]1"
  - "(5)[x]2"
  - "(5)[ ]3"
- Do NOT merge multiple [x] items into one.
