SUBSECTION BOUNDARY RULES (CRITICAL — FOLLOW EXACTLY):

1) A subsection starts ONLY when you see an explicit subsection label at line-start, e.g.:
   - "(1)" "(2)" "(3)" ... OR "(a)" "(b)" ... OR "a." "b." (if used in the document)
   Do NOT create new subsections from bracketed text like "[...]" or parenthetical phrases.

2) For each numeric subsection "(N)", the subsection_text MUST include ALL content that appears
   under "(N)" UNTIL the next numeric subsection label "(N+1)" at the same indentation level.
   This includes:
   - multiple paragraphs
   - blank lines
   - bracketed optional blocks like "[For all legal proceedings ...]"
   - inline options like "OR [ ... ]"
   - any continuation lines after a bracket block

3) Bracket blocks "[...]" are NOT subsection labels.
   They are ALWAYS part of the CURRENT subsection (usually continuing subsection (2)).

4) Paragraph order is POSITION-BOUND:
   - Do NOT move any paragraph from subsection (2) into subsection (3).
   - If subsection (2) contains multiple paragraphs, keep them in the same subsection_text
     in the same order (including blank lines).

5) When unsure whether a line belongs to (2) or (3), use the NEXT explicit label rule:
   - If the next explicit label "(3)" has not appeared yet, KEEP the text inside (2).
