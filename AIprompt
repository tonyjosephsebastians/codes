STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION RULES (CRITICAL):

A. Section numbers are POSITION-BOUND, not logical.
   - NEVER renumber sections.
   - NEVER shift content to a different section number.
   - If a section number exists in the document, return it EXACTLY as-is.
   - If a section number is missing or deleted, DO NOT reuse its number.

B. Paragraph boundaries are STRICT.
   - A paragraph belongs ONLY to the section number it appears under.
   - NEVER move a paragraph to the next or previous section.
   - NEVER merge paragraphs across section numbers.

C. Multi-paragraph sections:
   - If a section (e.g., "(2)") contains multiple paragraphs, ALL of them belong to that SAME section.
   - Do NOT split a section into multiple sections.
   - Do NOT assign later paragraphs to the next section number.

D. Deletion handling:
   - If a section is entirely deleted, SKIP it.
   - Do NOT renumber following sections.
   - Example: If section (9) is deleted, section (10) MUST remain "(10)".

E. Optional / bracketed text:
   - Bracketed alternatives (e.g., "[OR ...]") remain inside the SAME section.
   - NEVER treat bracketed alternatives as separate sections.

F. No reconstruction:
   - DO NOT infer logical structure.
   - DO NOT correct numbering.
   - DO NOT "fix" formatting.
   - Extract ONLY what is explicitly present in the document.




5. Extract subsections in the SAME order they appear in the document,
   using physical text position only — not logical interpretation.


FINAL VALIDATION CHECK (MANDATORY):

Before returning JSON:
- Verify that each section_number maps ONLY to text that appears under that number in the document.
- Verify that no section contains text that visually belongs to a different numbered section.
- If any ambiguity exists, KEEP content with its ORIGINAL section number.
